# emu3bm
emu3bm is an EMU3 bank manager. It allows to create banks and extract and append samples to existing EMU3 bank files.
It works with mono and stereo samples.

## Installation
Simply run `make && sudo make install`.

## Bugs
Sometimes, the sampler gives strange messages in the digital processing menu but everything seems to work as it should.
Due to the reverse engineering nature of the project, there might be other errors.
